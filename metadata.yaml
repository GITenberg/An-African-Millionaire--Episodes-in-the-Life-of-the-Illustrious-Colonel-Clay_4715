description: '"A genre classic, Grant Allen''s AN AFRICAN MILLIONAIRE is the perfect
  addition to our mini library of classic crime fiction. Wealthy, confident, and handsome,
  Charles Van Drift is not accustomed to being swindled and his brush with Colonel
  Clay both rattles and infuriates him. As his South African diamond fortune takes
  hit after hit from the quick-witted master of disguise, Allen leaves even the reader
  guessing: whom can you trust? Van Drift grows more suspicious of those around him
  and a few too many misguided accusations shake the millionaire''s confidence. Colonel
  Clay is in his head. Gary Hoppenstand contributes an introduction discussing the
  reception of the work when it was first serialized in THE STRAND and the significance
  of Colonel Clay as the first recurring gentleman rogue"--'
